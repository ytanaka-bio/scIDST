# scIDST (single-cell Identificaiton of Disease STate)
## Introduction
scIDST is designed to identify progressive disease states of individual cells from single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) by weekly-supervised deep learning approach. Recent advance of genomic sequencing technologies enables us to profile gene expression level at single-cell resolution and has been applied to various patient-derived samples. Importantly, individual cells in the surgically-resected biospecimen are in different disease state (e.g. a portion of cells are healthy, some cells are less progressive disease state). However, conventional scRNA-seq analysis (e.g. UMAP) can separete individual cells by cell types, but cannot distinguish cells in healthy and disease sate.
